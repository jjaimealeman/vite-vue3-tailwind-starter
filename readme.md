Trying to get the page title to reflect the current navigated page but I can't get anything to work.

Not even that one.

Filed an Issue with the repo maintainer 'web2033' and he replied how to fix the navigation issue I was having. [Simple solution](https://github.com/web2033/vite-vue3-tailwind-starter/issues/247#issuecomment-1033577225).

He also recommends this 3rd party addon:
- https://github.com/vueuse/head
> Document head manager for Vue 3.
>
> @vueuse/head is a Vue composition API that helps you manage <title>, <meta> and other elements inside document head, it has no dependencies and we always try to keep it as slim as possible.
